Smart Order is a desktop application built in Electron. It was designed to give bar managers an easy and smart way to order from multiple distributors. Put an order together on Smart Order and all of the contacts incorporated in that order get an email sent to them.

The front-end was built with AngularJS and styled with the help of Tachyons. On the back-end an express server was built using Node and Knex in order to connect to the Postgresql database. Email integration with Mailgun is in the next step.
